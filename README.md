Sublime-Like-Vim
================

This repository makes Sublime-Text-like-Vim environment especially in colorscheme.

Sublime-Like-Vim is originally based on monokai colorscheme, but looks more similar with Sublime Text than monokai.

Current version only supports C/C++ - it's the same as monokai in other languages.
